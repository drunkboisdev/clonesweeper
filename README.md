# Clonesweeper
A simple Minesweeper clone

## How to play
It's Minesweeper. Each tile shows how many mines are around it, left click to clear tiles, right click to flag mines, clear all the non-mine tiles to win.

## Why is only Expert difficulty available?
I didn't feel like rewriting the canvas to resize itself
